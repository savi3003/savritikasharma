                Currently studying Mathematics (majoring in 
                  Combinatorics and Optimization) at the University 
                  of Waterloo. Although Mathematics captivates
                   me, my passions spill over into the practical and 
                   immersive world of SWE and UX/UI design. <br> <br>

                  A beautiful intersection where logic meets creativity. <br>

        I've submerged myself in developing apps that ingeniously weave
        together the intricacies of mathematics and the user-friendly principles of 
        effective UX/UI design. Particularly, I have a passion for sculpting digital
        experiences concerning the daily needs and challenges of university
        students, much like myself. <br> <br>

      </h3>
      <h1>
        My motivation stems from the belief that 
        well-crafted products should serve people guiding them effortlessly 
        towards achieving their goals, whether that 
        involves completing a task, making 
         informed decisions, or simply providing a 
         canvas for self-expression.
      </h1>
      <p>
        <br><br> <br>
        For me, clarity isn't just a value; it's a guiding principle in my 
        developmental journey. I believe that the best products are those that
         require minimal thought and effort from the users, allowing them to 
         navigate through digital realms with intuitive ease. Every line of code I 
         write, every interface I design, is imbued with the intent to minimize 
         barriers to ensure that all users can engage, interact, and gain from the 
         digital solutions I create. <br> <br>  <br>

        Building with a conscious intent to reduce hurdles and promote inclusive
        engagement, I am on a perpetual journey to refine and optimize digital
        platforms, ensuring they are not just accessible, but genuinely user-friendly. 
        The beautiful challenge lies in crafting products that are as 
        intricate and complex behind the screens as they are simple and 
        effortless on the screens. This fusion of complexity and simplicity is 
        where I find my rhythm. I constantly explore, learn, and create with an 
        unwavering commitment to serve and uplift those who engage with my
        creations.<br><br>
